### Hi there 👋

**giperuzzo/giperuzzo** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- 🔭 I’m not currently working.
- 🌱 I’m currently studying Information Technology at Faculdade Univesp, also a FrontEnd course at Senai / Ford and BackEnd at Alura / Oracle to pursue a new professional career.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on with the team I intend to be part of, since learning in the area of ​​technology changes daily, and also count on the collaboration of other people with more experience.
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with referrals and an internship in the development area to put what I'm learning into practice on a daily basis.
- 💬 Ask me about my goals and challenges and I'll be happy to share this new trajectory of mine.
